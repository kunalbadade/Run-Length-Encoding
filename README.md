# Run-Length-Encoding
Run-length encoding (RLE) is a very simple form of lossless data compression. When encoding a text string, repeated consecutive characters are replaced by a single instance of that character and the number of occurrences of that character (the characterâ€™s run length). Decoding the encoded string results in the original string by repeating each character the number of times encoded by the run length.
